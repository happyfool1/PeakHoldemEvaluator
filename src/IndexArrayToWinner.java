* This Class is a data holding Class.

* 1. Draws  
* 2. Made Hands
* 3. Winning Showdown hands. 
* 
* There aee no public methods in this class.
* The constructor uses arguments that are arrays in IndexArrays and from these arrays

* These additional arrays are for convenience in analysis.
* Two classes are the users of this Class:
* 1. IndexArrayReport
* 2. IndexArrayAnalysis
*
* The first index int the arrays is some integer created from analyzing the board 
* or analyzing the hand ( board + hole cards )
* For example: HML is an index created by looking at the board cards and assigning 
* a value based on each cards value, high H is A - 10, Middle M is 9 -6, 
* and  low L is 5 - 2.

	Ideas TODO
	If you missed the flop: In this case, the optimal play depends on a variety of factors such as
	 your position, the number of opponents, their playing styles, and the betting action. 
	 You may consider bluffing if you were the pre-flop aggressor, especially if the flop is 
	 likely to have missed your opponents' ranges.
	
	If you have a draw: On a neutral board, you may have a decent draw such as a gutshot straight draw
	 or a flush draw. The general strategy is to continue with the hand if the pot odds justify it,
	  possibly through a semi-bluff or a call.
	
	If you have a pair (top pair or otherwise): With a pair on a neutral board, you should consider 
	the strength of your pair and the potential draws available. If you have top pair with a good 
	kicker or an overpair, you should generally bet for value. If you have a weaker pair, you might 
	want to play more cautiously, possibly checking or calling rather than betting or raising.
	
	
	Sure, the following Java function takes as input a Monte Carlo simulation result, represented as a 
	probability of winning, and returns a simple recommended action (CHECK, CALL, RAISE, or FOLD).
	Note that this method oversimplifies the strategic nuances of poker and doesn't consider the current pot size, the bet to you, the number of players left to act, your stack size, or opponent tendencies, but it can serve as a basic guideline.
	
	public class MonteCarloPokerStrategy {
	
	public enum Action {
	    CHECK, CALL, RAISE, FOLD
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    // testing
	    System.out.println(recommendAction(0.8)); // returns RAISE
	}
	
	public static Action recommendAction(double winProbability) {
	    if (winProbability > 0.75) {
	        return Action.RAISE;
	    } else if (winProbability > 0.5) {
	        return Action.CALL;
	    } else if (winProbability > 0.25) {
	        return Action.CHECK;
	    } else {
	        return Action.FOLD;
	    }
	}
	}
	This function interprets the winning probability in a straightforward way:
	
	If the winning probability is over 75%, it recommends raising, since your hand is strong.
	If the winning probability is between 50% and 75%, it recommends calling, as your hand is 
	likely competitive but not dominant.
	If the winning probability is between 25% and 50%, it recommends checking, since your hand
	might have potential but is currently weak.
	If the winning probability is below 25%, it recommends folding, as your hand is likely 
	not worth investing more chips.
	Again, this is a simplistic interpretation and should not be the sole determinant of your 
	poker strategy. Real game situations require a nuanced understanding of many additional factors.
	
	Calculating winning probability based on flop draws and made:
	If board is dry and hand or draw then probability good.
	If board is dry and no hand or draw then probability poor.
	If board is wet and hand or draw then probability good for draw, fair for hand.
	If board is wet and no hand or draw then probability poor.
	if board is neutral and hand or draw then probability poor for draw, good for hand.
	if board is neutral and no hand or draw then probability poor.
	
	Calculating winning probability based on flop and showdown winning hand:
	If made hand and that hand wins at showdown. TODO
	Need an array that relates hand on flop to win at showdown combined with index.
	So HML on flop, made and and showdown for that made hand

	boolean haveNothing = true;
	boolean haveMade = true;

	boolean haveTopPair = true;
	boolean haveWeakerPair = true;
	boolean haveGutshotDraw = true;
	boolean haveFlushDraw = true;
	boolean haveStraightDraw = true;
	
	Range Assessment: The results of your simulation can help you assess the range of hands 
	that your opponent could have. If a particular hand combination frequently wins in your 
	simulations, you can adjust your strategy to account for the possibility that your 
	opponent may have this hand.
	
	Bluffing Decisions: The results of your simulation can inform your bluffing decisions. 
	For example, if your simulations show that you have a low chance of winning the hand 
	with your current cards, you might choose to bluff, especially if your simulation 
	also suggests that your opponent is likely to have a weak hand.
	
	Betting Decisions: The results of your simulation can guide your betting decisions. 
	If your simulation shows a high probability of winning, you may choose to bet aggressively.
	Conversely, if your simulation shows a low probability of winning, you may choose to 
	bet conservatively or fold.
	
	Opponent Modeling: By combining the results of your simulations with observations about 
	your opponents' behavior, you can model how they play and make decisions that take advantage 
	of their weaknesses. If an opponent frequently folds in response to aggressive betting, 
	for example, you might choose to bet aggressively when your simulation shows that you
	have a moderately strong hand.
	
	Adaptation: Your simulation results can help you adapt your strategy as the game progresses.
	If your simulations suggest that certain hand combinations are particularly advantageous 
	or disadvantageous in the current game context, you can adapt your strategy to prioritize 
	or avoid these combinations.
	
	
	Certainly! Building on the understanding that you'll be utilizing the results of the 
	simulation to make strategic decisions, another way to characterize the flop could 
	be by considering Strength Level and Potential Hand Range.
	
	Strength Level: This categorizes the flop based on the perceived strength of your 
	hand relative to potential hands your opponents might have.
	
	Strong: The flop indicates a strong hand, such as a made hand or a very strong draw.
	Moderate: The flop suggests a moderately strong hand or a decent draw.
	Weak: The flop indicates a weak hand or a draw with limited potential.
	Potential Hand Range: This evaluates the range of possible hands that the 
	flop can complete or improve.
	
	Narrow: The flop narrows down the potential hand range, limiting the possible 
	combinations that your opponents might hold.
	Moderate: The flop provides moderate information about the potential hand range.
	Wide: The flop doesn't significantly narrow down the potential hand range, leaving it wide open.

	When playing poker, one's actions should generally depend on various factors, including the strength of one's hand, the texture of the board (wet or dry), the position, the actions of other players, and the specific tendencies of one's opponents. However, I understand that you're asking for some generalized guidelines.
	
	Remember, the following matrix is a simplification and should not be strictly adhered to. It's always important to consider the specific context of each hand:
	
	Wet hand fold bluff call raise
	Yes none 70% 20% 5% 5%
	Yes pair 30% 10% 40% 20%
	Yes 2 pair 10% 5% 30% 55%
	Yes set 5% 5% 20% 70%
	Yes gutshot draw 40% 30% 20% 10%
	Yes straight draw 30% 25% 35% 10%
	Yes OESD draw 20% 25% 35% 20%
	Yes flush draw 25% 20% 35% 20%
	
	This table reflects that players will generally be more aggressive (more calling, raising)
	with stronger hands (2 pair, set) and more likely to fold with weaker hands or bluffs. 
	Remember, percentages can vary significantly depending on specific situations and players involved.
	
	
	
	
	
	User
	show for dry flop and for neutral flop
	ChatGPT
	Sure, let's fill in a similar matrix for a dry and neutral flop, keeping in mind that the 
	exact percentages can vary based on a multitude of factors including the specific opponents, 
	stack sizes, position, and more.
	
	For a dry board:
	
	Dry hand fold bluff call raise
	Yes none 80% 15% 5% 0%
	Yes pair 25% 5% 60% 10%
	Yes 2 pair 5% 5% 30% 60%
	Yes set 5% 5% 20% 70%
	Yes gutshot draw 60% 30% 10% 0%
	Yes straight draw 50% 25% 20% 5%
	Yes OESD draw 40% 25% 30% 5%
	Yes flush draw 40% 20% 35% 5%
	
	On dry boards, bluffing frequencies can be lower as opponents are less likely to have hit a 
	part of the board, meaning our bluffs will often be successful.
	
	And for a neutral board:
	
	Neutral hand fold bluff call raise
	Yes none 75% 20% 5% 0%
	Yes pair 30% 10% 50% 10%
	Yes 2 pair 10% 5% 30% 55%
	Yes set 5% 5% 25% 65%
	Yes gutshot draw 50% 30% 15% 5%
	Yes straight draw 40% 25% 30% 5%
	Yes OESD draw 30% 20% 40% 10%
	Yes flush draw 35% 15% 40% 10%
	
	Again, these matrices are just generalized guides and your actions should always take 
	into account a wide variety of factors. Poker is a complex game and decisions should 
	not be made solely based on hand strength and flop texture.

    Ideas TODO
    If you missed the flop: In this case, the optimal play depends on a variety of factors such as
     your position, the number of opponents, their playing styles, and the betting action. 
     You may consider bluffing if you were the pre-flop aggressor, especially if the flop is 
     likely to have missed your opponents' ranges.
    
    If you have a draw: On a neutral board, you may have a decent draw such as a gutshot straight draw
     or a flush draw. The general strategy is to continue with the hand if the pot odds justify it,
      possibly through a semi-bluff or a call.
    
    If you have a pair (top pair or otherwise): With a pair on a neutral board, you should consider 
    the strength of your pair and the potential draws available. If you have top pair with a good 
    kicker or an overpair, you should generally bet for value. If you have a weaker pair, you might 
    want to play more cautiously, possibly checking or calling rather than betting or raising.
    
    
    Sure, the following Java function takes as input a Monte Carlo simulation result, represented as a 
    probability of winning, and returns a simple recommended action (CHECK, CALL, RAISE, or FOLD).
    Note that this method oversimplifies the strategic nuances of poker and doesn't consider the current pot size, the bet to you, the number of players left to act, your stack size, or opponent tendencies, but it can serve as a basic guideline.
    
    public class MonteCarloPokerStrategy {
    
    public enum Action {
        CHECK, CALL, RAISE, FOLD
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // testing
        System.out.println(recommendAction(0.8)); // returns RAISE
    }
    
    public static Action recommendAction(double winProbability) {
        if (winProbability > 0.75) {
            return Action.RAISE;
        } else if (winProbability > 0.5) {
            return Action.CALL;
        } else if (winProbability > 0.25) {
            return Action.CHECK;
        } else {
            return Action.FOLD;
        }
    }
    }
    This function interprets the winning probability in a straightforward way:
    
    If the winning probability is over 75%, it recommends raising, since your hand is strong.
    If the winning probability is between 50% and 75%, it recommends calling, as your hand is 
    likely competitive but not dominant.
    If the winning probability is between 25% and 50%, it recommends checking, since your hand
    might have potential but is currently weak.
    If the winning probability is below 25%, it recommends folding, as your hand is likely 
    not worth investing more chips.
    Again, this is a simplistic interpretation and should not be the sole determinant of your 
    poker strategy. Real game situations require a nuanced understanding of many additional factors.
    
    Calculating winning probability based on flop draws and made:
    If board is dry and hand or draw then probability good.
    If board is dry and no hand or draw then probability poor.
    If board is wet and hand or draw then probability good for draw, fair for hand.
    If board is wet and no hand or draw then probability poor.
    if board is neutral and hand or draw then probability poor for draw, good for hand.
    if board is neutral and no hand or draw then probability poor.
    
    Calculating winning probability based on flop and showdown winning hand:
    If made hand and that hand wins at showdown. TODO
    Need an array that relates hand on flop to win at showdown combined with index.
    So HML on flop, made and and showdown for that made hand
    
    public class IndexArrayStrategy implements Constants {
    boolean haveNothing = true;
    boolean haveMade = true;
    boolean haveDraw = true;
    boolean haveShowdown = true;
    boolean havePair = true;
    boolean haveTopPair = true;
    boolean haveWeakerPair = true;
    boolean haveGutshotDraw = true;
    boolean haveFlushDraw = true;
    boolean haveStraightDraw = true;
    
    Range Assessment: The results of your simulation can help you assess the range of hands 
    that your opponent could have. If a particular hand combination frequently wins in your 
    simulations, you can adjust your strategy to account for the possibility that your 
    opponent may have this hand.
    
    Bluffing Decisions: The results of your simulation can inform your bluffing decisions. 
    For example, if your simulations show that you have a low chance of winning the hand 
    with your current cards, you might choose to bluff, especially if your simulation 
    also suggests that your opponent is likely to have a weak hand.
    
    Betting Decisions: The results of your simulation can guide your betting decisions. 
    If your simulation shows a high probability of winning, you may choose to bet aggressively.
    Conversely, if your simulation shows a low probability of winning, you may choose to 
    bet conservatively or fold.
    
    Opponent Modeling: By combining the results of your simulations with observations about 
    your opponents' behavior, you can model how they play and make decisions that take advantage 
    of their weaknesses. If an opponent frequently folds in response to aggressive betting, 
    for example, you might choose to bet aggressively when your simulation shows that you
    have a moderately strong hand.
    
    Adaptation: Your simulation results can help you adapt your strategy as the game progresses.
    If your simulations suggest that certain hand combinations are particularly advantageous 
    or disadvantageous in the current game context, you can adapt your strategy to prioritize 
    or avoid these combinations.
    
    
    Certainly! Building on the understanding that you'll be utilizing the results of the 
    simulation to make strategic decisions, another way to characterize the flop could 
    be by considering Strength Level and Potential Hand Range.
    
    Strength Level: This categorizes the flop based on the perceived strength of your 
    hand relative to potential hands your opponents might have.
    
    Strong: The flop indicates a strong hand, such as a made hand or a very strong draw.
    Moderate: The flop suggests a moderately strong hand or a decent draw.
    Weak: The flop indicates a weak hand or a draw with limited potential.
    Potential Hand Range: This evaluates the range of possible hands that the 
    flop can complete or improve.
    
    Narrow: The flop narrows down the potential hand range, limiting the possible 
    combinations that your opponents might hold.
    Moderate: The flop provides moderate information about the potential hand range.
    Wide: The flop doesn't significantly narrow down the potential hand range, leaving it wide open.

    This gives a simple measure of how "good" the hand is, with a higher score indicating a better hand.

    When playing poker, one's actions should generally depend on various factors, including the strength of one's hand, the texture of the board (wet or dry), the position, the actions of other players, and the specific tendencies of one's opponents. However, I understand that you're asking for some generalized guidelines.
    
    Remember, the following matrix is a simplification and should not be strictly adhered to. It's always important to consider the specific context of each hand:
    
    Wet hand fold bluff call raise
    Yes none 70% 20% 5% 5%
    Yes pair 30% 10% 40% 20%
    Yes 2 pair 10% 5% 30% 55%
    Yes set 5% 5% 20% 70%
    Yes gutshot draw 40% 30% 20% 10%
    Yes straight draw 30% 25% 35% 10%
    Yes OESD draw 20% 25% 35% 20%
    Yes flush draw 25% 20% 35% 20%
    
    This table reflects that players will generally be more aggressive (more calling, raising)
    with stronger hands (2 pair, set) and more likely to fold with weaker hands or bluffs. 
    Remember, percentages can vary significantly depending on specific situations and players involved.

    Sure, let's fill in a similar matrix for a dry and neutral flop, keeping in mind that the 
    exact percentages can vary based on a multitude of factors including the specific opponents, 
    stack sizes, position, and more.
    
    For a dry board:
    
    Dry hand fold bluff call raise
    Yes none 80% 15% 5% 0%
    Yes pair 25% 5% 60% 10%
    Yes 2 pair 5% 5% 30% 60%
    Yes set 5% 5% 20% 70%
    Yes gutshot draw 60% 30% 10% 0%
    Yes straight draw 50% 25% 20% 5%
    Yes OESD draw 40% 25% 30% 5%
    Yes flush draw 40% 20% 35% 5%
    
    On dry boards, bluffing frequencies can be lower as opponents are less likely to have hit a 
    part of the board, meaning our bluffs will often be successful.
    
    And for a neutral board:
    
    Neutral hand fold bluff call raise
    Yes none 75% 20% 5% 0%
    Yes pair 30% 10% 50% 10%
    Yes 2 pair 10% 5% 30% 55%
    Yes set 5% 5% 25% 65%
    Yes gutshot draw 50% 30% 15% 5%
    Yes straight draw 40% 25% 30% 5%
    Yes OESD draw 30% 20% 40% 10%
    Yes flush draw 35% 15% 40% 10%
    
    Again, these matrices are just generalized guides and your actions should always take 
    into account a wide variety of factors. Poker is a complex game and decisions should 
    not be made solely based on hand strength and flop texture.
