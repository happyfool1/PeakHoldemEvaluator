    /*-  **************************************************************************
    *
    * This class contains methods that characterize the boards foe Flop, Turn, River
    * and hands ( board+ hole Cards )
    * This class is used to analyze thousands or millions of simulated hands.
    * Using a monti carlo methodology determine characteristics of a Hold'em 
    * 6-max no limit game. 
    * Specifically to find ways to characterize a Flop, such as HML ( High Medium Low )
    * which results in only 10 Flop types. A million or more hands are run, and for 
    * each hand run the draws and made hands and other data is analyzed and collected
    * in arrays which will be analuzed after a run is completed. 
    * We analyze each street and Showdown.
    * 
    * This is not a final implememtation. We will be experimenting contineously 
    * trying to find ways to characterize a Flop that will result in  information on
    * how best to play a hand. 
    * For example for a Flop type:
    *   It may result in a high percentage of made hands and we do not have a made hand.
    *   It may result in a low percentage of made hands and we hve have a made hand.
    *   It may result in a hiogh percentage of strong draws.
    *   It may result in a low percentage of strong draws.
    *   It may result in a a high percentage of times that the made hand is the winning
    *   hand at Showdown.
    *   And many more.
