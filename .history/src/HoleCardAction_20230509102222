/*- ******************************************************************************
 * This class defines a range of hands The hands are in a Container class. 
 * This array represents the commonly used 13 X 13 matrix to represent suited,
 * ofsuit, and pairs
 * An element is true if that card is in the range.
 * 
 * In previkous versions a 13 X 13 array was indexd directly.
 * If the values in the array are assigned in playability order or Expected Value 
 * order then we can simply use that single value and not an array at all.
 * 
 * The purpose of this class ( and the previous HandRange class) is to select an action
 * based or on the hole cards. 
 * 
 * The hole cards are represented by the 13 X 13 matrix index for a value of 
 * 0 to 168.
 * 
 * The action is based on the bet that the player is facing:
 *      REFLOP_LIMP, PREFLOP_OPEN, PREFLOP_CALL, PREFLOP_BET3, PREFLOP_BET4, 
 *      PREFLOP_ALLIN, PREFLOP_CALL_ALLIN. 
 * 
 * The player can respond to the action to him by:
 *      LIMP, OPEN, CALL, BET3, CALL_BET3, BET4, CALL_BET4, ALLIN, CALL_ALLIN.
 *
 * In this class we use an array of index values that represent the last value for 
 * the last card in that range. 
 * Ranges are creted in either playability or EV order, so it is contigueous with
 * no gaps. The last card is all that we need.
 * 
 * THis class supports all combinations of actions to a player and the response 
 * based on the hole cards index ( 0 - 168).
 * 
 * We use an 2 dimensional array. The first indexis the action to the playes,
 * PREFLOP_x. The second index is the response FOLD, LIMP, ...
 * The value in the array is the largest hole card index that supports the action.
